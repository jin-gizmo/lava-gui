The Flet based version of the lava GUI was built by two of our IBL (Industry
Based Learning) undergraduates, Art Dorokhov, Nyan Min Khant (Michael), who both
did an excellent job recreating and improving the original PySimpleGui based
horror while wrestling Flet into submission.

Thanks also to Alex Boul for guiding the IBLs during the process, adding some
nice functional improvements, fixing bugs and putting up with my moaning about
the nightmare that is Windows.
