# Release Notes

### v.2.3.0

This is the initial open source release. There are some minor documentation and
packaging updates but no code changes in the core app.

The key change is that the Windows version of the app will now install in
`Program Files` (the correct place for a 64 bit app) instead of `Program Files (x86)`,
(the wrong place for a 64 bit app).

The previous version of the app should be uninstalled before installing this
version. The normal Windows **Add or remove programs** is the way to do this.
