The **lava GUI** is a standalone GUI client for
[lava](https://github.com/jin-gizmo/lava) built on [Flet](https://flet.dev) /
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). It's fairly basic but surprisingly handy,
particularly when working across multiple lava realms and AWS accounts.

## Genesis

**Lava** was developed at [Origin Energy](https://www.originenergy.com.au)
as part of the *Jindabyne* initiative. While not part of our core IP, it proved
valuable internally, and we're sharing it in the hope it's useful to others.

Kudos to Origin for fostering a culture that empowers its people
to build complex technology solutions in-house.
